### **Installing the simpl\_eeg package in a new environment**

Please open your Unix shell (i.e. terminal on a Mac, GitBash on Windows) and navigate to a folder you will use to store the files (if you've never used a terminal before please look at the following instructions <https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/02-filedir/index.html> to help you navigate). Some basic commands which might help include...

-   `cd` move to a different directory

    -   `cd/folder` moves you into that folder and makes it your current directory

    -   `cd..` moves you back out of the folder you are currently in
