# Install guide

## Pre-requisite computer setup

If you have never used terminal before, please consult the following instructions in order to setup up the necessary tools. These instructions will continue to be update into the future so they should remain current.

Please fully install the sections with the following headers...

-   Windows

    -   Git and Bash
    -   Python and Conda

-   Mac and Ubuntu

    -   Git
    -   Python and Conda

## Package Installation

### Installing the simpl\_eeg package in a new environment

Please open your Unix shell (i.e. terminal on a Mac, GitBash on Windows) and navigate to a folder you will use to store the files (if you've never used a terminal before please look at the following instructions <https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/02-filedir/index.html> to help you navigate). Your current directory ("location" in your computer files) is listed after `(base)`. Some basic commands which might help navigate include...

-   `ls` list all files/folders in your current directory

-   `cd` move to a different directory

    -   `cd/folder` moves you into that folder and makes it your current directory.

    -   `cd..` moves you one layer out of the folder you are currently in to one directory above it.

Pro tip: press `tab` when typing a file location to use auto-complete and have the remainder of the file name be completed automatically. For example, typing 'M' (then pressing `tab`) will have the terminal automatically match the file name 'MDS' since there are no other files names which start with 'M').

Then clone our repo using...

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UBC-MDS/simpl_eeg_capstone.git
```

And enter the root of the directory using...

```bash
cd simpl_eeg_capstone
```

![](instruction_imgs/navigation2.png)

After navigating to the root of the directory in terminal (i.e. being within the 'simpl\_eeg\_capstone' folder) Run the following commands...

```bash
conda create â€“name simpl_eeg
```
(then press "y" to accept when prompted)

```bash
conda activate simpl_eeg
```
(this activates the newly created environment).

```bash
conda install ipykernel
```
(then press "y" to accept)

```bash
conda install nb_conda_kernels
```
(then press "y" to accept)

Finally, double check that you are in the simple\_eeg\_capstone directory and install the package contents using...

```bash 
pip install -e .
```

So what have we done? We created an environment to contain the package that we have prepared. This environment can be activated in any terminal window using the `conda activate simple_eeg` command (this must be done every time you re-open the app/terminal window). You will know that you are in this environment when the bracketed words in the terminal say `(simple_eeg)` like such...

## Streamlit

### Launching The Streamlit UI

Navigate to the root of the directory and run the following command (this will lock this terminal window into running the app until it is shut down)...

```bash
streamlit run src/app.py
```

![](instruction_imgs/streamlit.png)

This will cause the UI to open in your browser like such...

![](instruction_imgs/streamlit2.png)

You can refresh the UI to restart it or open it in another window by copying the url (<http://localhost:8501/>). *Note, the port "8501" may vary depending on how many sessions you have running*

### Shutting down Streamlit App

When you are done (or if you need to restart the app) simply navigate back to the Terminal window you used to launch the app and press `Ctrl + C` (PC/Linux) or `Command + C` (Mac) and then press 'y' to confirm to shut down the app. This will return the terminal window to the state that it was in before launching the app, allowing you to type commands again.

### Troubleshooting Streamlit

Every subsequent time you open the UI remember to activate the simple\_eeg environment and open it from the correct location (the root of the directory).

You can set your current environment for the terminal tab you're in using the following command...

```bash
conda activate simpl_eeg
```

Being in the root of the directory means that your location in terminal should end with `simpl_eeg_capstone$`

For example...

`(simpl_eeg) mpin@Matthews-MacBook-Pro:~/Documents/MDS/capstone/simpl_eeg_capstone$`

## JupyterLab

### Using the package in JupyterLab

Please complete the JuptyerLab setup section in the following link if you have not installed it yet (<https://ubc-mds.github.io/resources_pages/installation_instructions/>)

The instructions for how to use the package are in a JupyterNotebook stored in `simpl_eeg_capstone/simple_instructions/instructions.ipynb`. After installing JuptyerLab you should be able to open the program by typing...

```bash
jupyter lab
```

![](instruction_imgs/jupyter_lab3.png)

in the command line. This will open a new tab in your browser...

![](instruction_imgs/jupyter_lab.png)

You can now open the instructions notebook in the location `simple_instructions/instructions.ipynb`

![](instruction_imgs/jupyter_lab2.png)

When you have the instructions open make sure that you are in the correct environment. If you are not you can click the dropdown and select `simple_eeg`.

![](instruction_imgs/jupyter_lab4.png)

To run use JuptyerLab click on any cell and push `shift + enter` to cause all of the python code in the cell to run. If you need any additional help please consult the following guide <https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/>.

### Shutting down JupyterLab

Navigate back to the terminal window you used to launch JupyterLab and press `Ctr + C` (Windows/Linux) or `Command + C` (Mac) and then press `y` to confirm and shut down the notebook. This will free up this terminal window and allow you to type commands again.
