    "Electroencephalograms (EEG) is an electrophysiological measurement method used to examine the electrical activity of the brain and represent it as location-based channels of waves and frequencies. EEG benefits from being inexpensive and unobtrusive, leading to its widespread use in diagnosing brain disorders such as epilepsy and brain damage from head injuries. EEG data is recorded with high dimensionality, so the use of visualizations and metrics is essential for the data to be easily interpreted by humans. Currently, the options for visualizing EEG data require the use of complicated packages or software and the functionally is often limited.\n",
