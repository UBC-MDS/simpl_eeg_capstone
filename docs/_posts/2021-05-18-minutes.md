- Overview of proposal - eliminating stretch goal
- Yiki function demonstration, description of what she's been working on
	- How did you construct the surface? Nearest Neighbour cubic method from scipy
	- 2 things - interpolation for colour and shape
	- Suggestion: for surface interpolation use higher number of points - can have 192 locations based on standard mappings, can use those EEG coordinate points with all electrodes to do interpolation for the surface. Then more of a 2D -> 3D mapping.

- Matt function demonstration 
	- Manually animate 2D image rather than using built in MNE
	- Customizations - settting max and min, color type, point type, remove colourbar, change # contours
	- Request: view side, middle, top, oblique (crono view, sagittal view, axial view, oblique view)
	- Request: can they be side by side horizontally (2 x 2)?
	- Voltage -> should be a bit bigger than 10 to -10
- Garoub function demonstration
 	- Questions about impact time
- Sasha function demonstration
	- Might as well keep both
	- Option for connectivity to be in groups
