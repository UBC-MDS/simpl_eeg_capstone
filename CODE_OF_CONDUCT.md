## Lawfulness

### 1a. Lawful knowledge and adherence

We as the project contributors and maintainers will always act in accordance with the law, developing a full knowledge of, and ensuring compliance with, all relevant regulatory regimes.

### 1b. Privacy and confidentiality protection

We as the project contributors and maintainers have a duty to act so as to protect the privacy and confidentiality of data, respecting the ownership of proprietary data, and in not exposing data (within private or public fora) that might cause any harm to individuals or legal entities.

### 1c. Equality legislation

We as the project contributors and maintainers have a duty not to break gender, race, ethnicity, martial status, religion, belief, disability, or age equality legislation. In particular, such attributes should not place individuals at any disadvantage within models or any automated decisions.

## Dealing with Data

### 2a. Surrogate features and bias

We as the project contributors and maintainers are responsible for detecting and flagging features that might be surrogate to other features that violate fundamental equality rights (gender, race, religion, etc). In general proxy features need to always be checked against social discriminating features (see also 1c. Equality legislation)

### 2b. De-Identification

We as the project contributors and maintainers shall not apply any technique (combination, enriching, etc) to turn information that has been designed to be “de-identifiable” into “identifiable” again.

## Transparency Objectivity and Truth

### 3a. Transparency as a duty

We as the project contributors and maintainers will strive for transparency within as wide a forum as allowable by legal and proprietary constraints. The data scientist will not withhold concerns or potential limitations form colleagues.

## Working with others

### 4a. Collegiality

We as the project contributors and maintainers will always act in a collegiate manner with colleagues. This includes disclosing any facts, assessments, or insights that may be relevant to colleagues’ own data science work.

### 4b. Duty to speak up

We as the project contributors and maintainers have a professional duty to raise concerns over any potential breaches to this code by us or by others to relevant authorities and management, usually the line manager of any person possibly involved in a breach.

### 4c. Code Awareness and adherence

We as the project contributors and maintainers shall be aware of this code of conduct and apply it in each and every situation where data is involved.

### 4d. Team code acquaintance and deviating behaviors

We as the project contributors and maintainers shall make sure that all colleagues in the working environment are acquainted with the code and flag behaviors that deviate from the clauses of this code.
